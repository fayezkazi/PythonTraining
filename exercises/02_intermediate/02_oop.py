# Exercise 5.1: Basic class
# TODO: Create a class called 'Dog' with attributes: name, breed, age
# Include a __init__ method and a method called 'bark' that prints "{name} says Woof!"


# TODO: Create an instance of the Dog class and call the bark method


# Exercise 5.2: Class with properties
# TODO: Create a class called 'BankAccount' with:
# - Private attribute _balance (initialized in __init__)
# - Method deposit(amount) to add to balance
# - Method withdraw(amount) to subtract from balance (check if sufficient funds)
# - Method get_balance() to return the balance


# TODO: Create an instance, make some deposits and withdrawals, and print the balance


# Exercise 5.3: Inheritance
# TODO: Create a base class 'Animal' with method 'speak'
# Create two subclasses 'Cat' and 'Bird' that override the speak method


# TODO: Create instances of Cat and Bird and call their speak methods


# Exercise 5.4: Class methods and static methods
# TODO: Create a class 'MathOperations' with:
# - A class variable 'pi' set to 3.14159
# - A static method 'add' that takes two numbers and returns their sum
# - A class method 'circle_area' that takes radius and calculates area using pi


# TODO: Call the static method and class method


# Exercise 5.5: Magic methods
# TODO: Create a class 'Vector' with x and y coordinates
# Implement __init__, __str__, __add__ (for adding two vectors)
# and __eq__ (for comparing two vectors)


# TODO: Create two vectors, add them, and print the result
