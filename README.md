## ✅ Solutions

Each exercise has a corresponding solution file in the `solutions/` directory. Solutions demonstrate one way to solve the exercises, but remember:
- There are often multiple correct solutions
- Try to solve exercises yourself before checking solutions
- Compare your solution with the provided one to learn different approaches

## 📖 How to Use

### For Self-Study

1. **Start with the basics** (if you're new to Python)
2. **Read the exercise file** and understand what's required
3. **Try to solve the exercise** without looking at the solution
4. **Run your code** to test it:
   ```bash
   python exercises/01_basics/01_variables.py
   ```
5. **Check the solution** if you get stuck or want to compare approaches
6. **Experiment** by modifying the code and seeing what happens

### For Instructors

- Use exercises as homework assignments
- Solutions can serve as answer keys
- Modify exercises to suit your teaching needs
- Add your own exercises following the same structure

### Best Practices

- **Write code**, don't just read it
- **Experiment** with variations of each exercise
- **Break things** - errors are learning opportunities
- **Comment your code** to explain your thinking
- **Practice regularly** - consistency is key
